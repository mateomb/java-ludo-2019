# java-ludo-2019
Application that simulates the game Ludo. Allows for multiple players(up to 4)

Pure java project made as a project submission. 
The application was done a long time ago when I was learning programming and as such many features do not work as intended.
I intend on revisit this project on a later date and make a fully functional game.
